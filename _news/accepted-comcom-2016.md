Opportunistic networks can increase network capacity, support collaborative downloading of content and offload traffic from a cellular to a cellular-assisted, device-to-device network. They can also support communication and content exchange when the cellular infrastructure is under severe stress and when the network is down or inaccessible. Fountain coding has been considered as especially suitable for lossy networks, providing reliable multicast transport without requiring feedback from receivers. It is also ideal for multi-path and multi-source communication that fits exceptionally well with opportunistic networks. In this paper, we propose a content-centric approach for disseminating content in opportunistic networks efficiently and reliably. Our approach is based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) and employs fountain coding. When tied together, ICN and fountain coding provide a comprehensive solution that overcomes significant limitations of existing approaches. Extensive network simulations indicate that our approach is viable. Cache hit ratio can be increased by up to five times, while the overall network traffic load is reduced by up to four times compared to content dissemination on top of the standard Named Data Networking architecture.
