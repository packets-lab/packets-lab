M. Alasmar, G. Parisis and J. Crowcroft, “Polyraptor: Embracing Path and Data Redundancy in Data Centres for Efficient Data Transport”, In Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM (poster session), 2018.

In this paper, we introduce Polyraptor, a novel data transport protocol that uses RaptorQ (RQ) codes and is tailored for one-to-many and many-to-one data transfer patterns, which are extremely common in modern data centres. Polyraptor builds on previous work on fountain coding-based transport and provides excellent performance, by exploiting native support for multicasting in data centres and data resilience provided by data replication.
