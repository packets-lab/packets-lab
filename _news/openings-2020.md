title: Fully funded PhD studentships available!
---

<div class="border border-danger rounded mb-2">
We are currently advertising a number of fully-funded PhD studentships in the broader areas of computer network management and protocols with a focus on machine learning (e.g. automated network management by exploiting inferred functional and causal dependencies, machine-learned congestion control and routing policies with reinforcement learning) and information-theoretical approaches (e.g. RaptorQ coding for efficient data transport).

See <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/fees-funding/phd-funding/view/1199-5-PhD-Studentships-in-Network-Science" target="_blank"> here </a> for more details.
