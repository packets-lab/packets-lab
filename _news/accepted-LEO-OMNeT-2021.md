A. Valentine and G. Parisis, “Developing and experimenting with LEO satellite constellations in OMNeT++”, In Proceedings of the 8th OMNeT++ Community Summit, 2021.

In this paper, we present our work in designing and implementing a LEO satellite constellation simulation model1 within OMNeT++ and INET, which is validated by com- paring the results with existing work. Our model builds upon the fundamentals of the Open Source Satellite Simulator (OS3 ), which was ported to INET 4.3. We describe how the model was integrated on top of the INET and ported OS3 Framework. We then experiment with the simulation model to demonstrate its viability in simulating LEO satellite constellations. This involved simulating both outdated and more recent satellite constellations, using FCC filing information, to validate latency results.
