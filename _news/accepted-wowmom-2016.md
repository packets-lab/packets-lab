A. Rajaei, D. Chalmers, I. Wakeman, and G. Parisis, “GSAF: Efficient and Flexible Geocasting for Opportunistic Networks”, In Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2016.

With the proliferation of smartphones and their advanced connectivity capabilities, opportunistic networks have gained a lot of traction during the past years; they are suitable for increasing network capacity and sharing ephemeral, localised content. They can also offload traffic from cellular networks to device-to-device ones, when cellular networks are heavily stressed. Opportunistic networks can play a crucial role in communication scenarios where the network infrastructure is inaccessible due to natural disasters, large-scale terrorist attacks or government censorship. Geocasting, where messages are destined to specific locations (casts) instead of explicitly identified devices, has a large potential in real world opportunistic networks, however it has attracted little attention in the context of opportunistic networking. In this paper we propose Geocasting Spray And Flood (GSAF), a simple but efficient and flexible geocasting protocol for opportunistic, delay-tolerant networks. GSAF follows a simple but elegant and flexible approach where messages take random walks towards the destination cast. Messages that follow directions away from the cast are extinct when the device buffer gets full, freeing space for new messages to be delivered. In GSAF, casts do not have to be pre-defined; instead users can route messages to arbitrarily defined casts. Our extensive evaluation shows that GSAF is efficient, in terms of message delivery ratio and latency as well as network overhead.
