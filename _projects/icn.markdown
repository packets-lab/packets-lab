We have developed *blackadder*, the first ICN network node architecture (including an in-kernel network stack), which supports large scale native or overlaid ICN deployments as well as direct integration with distributed ns-3 simulations and emulations. We have conducted extensive evaluation with *blackadder* in large-scale deployments around the world and in high-performance testbeds. Along with European collaborators, we have been investigating how storage replication and caching can improve the performance of information-centric networks and how ICN can enable efficient and seamless user mobility. We have been researching how ICN can enable application diversity through an ICN application design paradigm and integration approaches with SDNs.

#### funding

The work has been primarily funded by the PURSUIT FP7 EU project which included research partnerships with organisations across the world (e.g. MIT, NICT Japan, Ericsson).
