# packets research lab

We are a research lab based at the [School of Engineering and Informatics](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/ei/), [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/). Our ambition is to design robust and efficient networks for the future.

We conduct trans-disciplinary research at the intersection of computer networks, machine learning, complex systems and software verification, with a focus on **network protocol design**, **management** and **verification**. Our funders include [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/), [Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk), [Moogsoft](https://www.moogsoft.com/) and [Sprint Electric](https://www.sprint-electric.com/).

Details of our research can be found in the [projects](/projects) page.
