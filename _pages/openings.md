<!-- We are currently advertising a number of fully-funded PhD studentships in the broader areas of computer network management and protocols with a focus on machine learning (e.g. automated network management by exploiting inferred functional and causal dependencies, machine-learned congestion control and routing policies with reinforcement learning) and information-theoretical approaches (e.g. RaptorQ coding for efficient data transport).

See <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/fees-funding/phd-funding/view/1199-5-PhD-Studentships-in-Network-Science" target="_blank"> here </a> for more details. -->

<hr class="hr-default">

We are always looking for bright people to join our lab! We are a friendly and inclusive group that aim at delivering top-quality research and contribute in designing future-proof and robust networks.

#### prospective PhD students
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student, please send an [email](mailto:G.Parisis@sussex.ac.uk) and state briefly why you are interested and attach a CV. Formal applications should be submitted through the [university portal](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/apply){:target="_blank"} where you need to indicate the supervisor.

#### prospective research fellows and interns
If you are interested in spending some time with us (e.g. as visiting researchers, or summer interns), let us know and we may be able to host you. There are European ([Marie Curie](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en){:target="_blank"}) and UK ([EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/skills/fellows/overview/){:target="_blank"}) fellowships for early career researchers for which we would consider acting as the host and support you in applying.
